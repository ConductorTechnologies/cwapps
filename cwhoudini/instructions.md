Congratulations! You're set to start submitting renders to Conductor from within Houdini. Open Houdini and load the Conductor HDA from the Asset Manager. You should see a new node called "Conductor" available in the Network Editor. Add this node to your network and connect it to your render or simulation node to configure a submission.

### Notes for system administrators
